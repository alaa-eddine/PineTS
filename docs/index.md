# PineTS

PineTS is a TypeScript implementation of the Pine Script language, allowing you to write trading indicators and strategies using TypeScript while leveraging the power of Pine Script's execution model and functions.

With PineTS, you can create, test and visualize technical indicators using modern web technologies while maintaining compatibility with the Pine Script language features.

# Demo

This is a BTCUSDT chart with the Williams Vix Fix indicator applied.
The chart data and indicator are generated using PineTS, showcasing the capabilities of the library in creating interactive and dynamic charts.

The visualization is done using the [Lightweight Charts](https://tradingview.github.io/lightweight-charts/) library.
